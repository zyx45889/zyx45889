I am Yixin Zeng (曾一欣), a CS master student (since 2022) at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. [Hongzhi Wu](https://hongzhiwu.com/). Prior to this, I accomplished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology, graduating from the Chu Kochen College at Zhejiang University in 2022. From June to November 2024, I served as an visiting student researcher at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), working with Prof. [Min H. Kim](https://vclab.kaist.ac.kr/minhkim/).


**Research Interest:** Computer Graphics, and Computational Imaging.
